# Kaizen Store

An AI-native online store selling EU-wide, built from scratch. The research and
phased build plan are in `docs/plan.md`; read it before architectural work.

## Stack

- Next.js 16.3 (App Router, `cacheComponents` on), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, pnpm.
- Supabase project "Kaizen Store" (`ybsozesfuxuitoacntfo`, eu-west-1 Ireland).
- Vercel functions pinned to `dub1` (Dublin) in `vercel.json` to sit next to the
  database. Keep data processing in the EU when adding any vendor.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev         # local dev server
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test        # Vitest unit tests (src/**/*.test.ts)
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e    # Playwright against `pnpm start`; build first
pnpm db:generate # write a migration after changing src/db/schema.ts
pnpm db:check    # fails if migrations and schema disagree (runs in CI)
node scripts/db-setup.mjs --seed  # migrations + demo catalogue on an empty DATABASE_URL
```

`pnpm build` and the storefront need a database: product lists are prerendered
from it. Locally, point `DATABASE_URL` at an empty Postgres and run
`scripts/db-setup.mjs --seed` first; CI does the same with a Postgres service.

In a sandbox with a preinstalled Chromium, set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` instead
of running `playwright install`.

## Database

- Commerce tables live in the private `commerce` schema (`src/db/schema.ts`),
  which Supabase does not expose through its Data API. Server code reaches it
  through `db()` in `src/db/client.ts` (needs `DATABASE_URL`).
- Migrations are generated into `supabase/migrations`. Rules Drizzle cannot
  express (functions, triggers, reference data) go in a custom migration:
  `pnpm exec drizzle-kit generate --custom --name <name>`.
- `src/db/commerce.test.ts` applies every migration to PGlite and tests the
  invariants. Add a test with any new rule.
- Money is integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 code (`src/lib/money.ts`).
  Prices are VAT-inclusive per market and only change through
  `commerce.set_price`; advertised reductions use `prior_30d_minor` from
  `commerce.current_prices`.

## Storefront

- Routes: `/` is a market chooser (suggests, never redirects); `/no`, `/se`,
  `/dk` are markets, each its own root layout with its own `<html lang>`.
  `src/lib/markets.ts` lists the routed markets; a test keeps it in step with
  `commerce.markets`.
- Interface text lives in `src/lib/i18n.ts`. Legal texts do not: they need
  human review.
- Catalogue reads in `src/server/catalog.ts` are cached (`'use cache'`, tag
  `catalog`); stock is read per request inside `<Suspense>`.
- Prices are shown with `<Price>`, which adds the VAT label and shows the
  30-day reference only for a genuine reduction.
- Product pages are prerendered for every product at build time, so their
  content is plain HTML; stock and add-to-cart stream in and need JavaScript.
- The cart (`src/server/cart.ts`) is per market, identified by an httpOnly
  cookie. Adding checks live stock and caps the quantity; stock is only held
  once checkout starts. Mutations are server actions that call `refresh()`.
- Payment credentials and payment-method switches are store settings edited in
  the admin, never environment variables (decision D15).

## Conventions

- Environment variables are validated in `src/lib/env.ts` when used, not at
  import, so builds and tests run without secrets.
- Server-only modules import `server-only`.
- AI features must stay grounded: the model never states a price, stock level or
  product it was not given by a tool; arithmetic happens in code; model output is
  rendered as text, never as HTML.
