Every change to a published contract gets a version here, newest first: the Admin API (`/api/admin/v1/openapi.json`), the storefront API
(`/api/storefront/v1/openapi.json`), the webhook topics (`/api/webhooks/v1/topics.json`) and the MCP catalogues (`/api/mcp/catalogue.json`,
`/api/ucp/catalogue.json`). Within a major version nothing a caller relies on is renamed or removed; answers and payloads may gain fields.

## 1.0 — 2026-11-03

Contracts published.

- The Admin API's OpenAPI 3.1 document, generated from the operations themselves: every operation's parameters, body, answer and
  refusals, the scope each needs, pages, the rate limit and `Idempotency-Key`. Every write now checks its body before anything runs and says
  what is wrong in a 422 (discount codes, checkout rules and questions, and customer tags included).
- The storefront API's document now holds every route's query, body and answer.
- The webhook topics with the shape of each payload's `data`, the headers and how to check a signature, at `/api/webhooks/v1/topics.json`
  and in the Admin API's document (`webhooks`). A test delivery's sample order now has every field a real order has.
- The owner MCP's tool catalogue and the shopping agents', each tool with a title and MCP annotations (read-only, destructive, idempotent,
  open world); `tools/list` answers them too.
- The owner MCP takes OAuth 2.1 tokens from Kaizena Flow's own authorization server (D439): any MCP client connects at
  `https://kaizenaflow.com/api/mcp`, finds the server through `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, and asks the person on Kaizena Flow's consent screen. Each tool in the catalogue names the
  `scope` a token needs for it (one per staff permission, plus `stores:read`); a call outside the token's scopes answers 403 with an
  `insufficient_scope` challenge, and `tools/list` lists only what the token can call.
